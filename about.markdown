I enjoy designing and developing GIS solutions and tools. Currently, I work as a full-stack web and Unreal Engine developer at DLR Group in Los Angeles.

I took some supplemental computer science courses in school, but my focus was on geography/GIS. As a result, much of my software development learning is thanks to the incredible writing and curriculum design of (in no particular order):
